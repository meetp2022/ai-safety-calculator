# Scoring Model: TIS (Task Impact Score)

The calculator uses the following formula to determine AI impact:

`TIS = (AS × ACM × AF) × (1 − HAF)`

### Variables
- **AS (Automation Suitability):** Physical vs. Digital nature of the task.
- **ACM (AI Capability Maturity):** Current state-of-the-art capability for this task.
- **AF (Adoption Friction):** Economic, legal, or social barriers.
- **HAF (Human Advantage Factor):** Requirement for empathy, ethics, or complex physical dexterity.

### Job Selection Modifier
We apply an experience modifier to the final aggregate:
- **Entry Level:** 1.1x (Higher exposure to standard tasks)
- **Expert:** 0.7x (Higher requirement for rare judgment)
