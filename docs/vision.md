# Project Overview: AI Job Safety Calculator

## Vision
To provide a calm, data-driven, and task-oriented analysis of how AI is likely to impact specific job roles. We focus on "Task Impact" rather than "Job Replacement" to help professionals navigate the transition toward human-advantage skills.

## Core MVP Principles
- **Tap-Only UI:** Zero text entry or complex sliders.
- **Explainable Scoring:** Based on a deterministic formula (TIS).
- **Non-Alarming Language:** Using constructive terms like "Shift" and "Augment".

## Methodology
The tool breaks down a job into component tasks. Each task is scored against automation suitability and AI maturity, then weighted by how often the user says they perform it.
